1. defference between EWxceoption and Error

1. Exception :
i. Exceptions occurs because of program.
ii. Exceptions are recoverable means that programmers can handle them using try-catch block.
iii. Exception are of two types:
    1. Compile time exceptions or checked exceptions.
    2. Runtime Exceptions or Unchecked Exceptions.
 
2.Error :
 i. Error occurs because of lack of system resources.
 ii. Error are  not reecoverable , programmers can handle them to their level
 iii. Error are only of one types:
     1. Runtime Exceptions or Unchecked Exception.
     

Wrong concept : compile time exception occurs at compile time and runtime exeception occurs at run time.
Right concept : All the exception are occurs at runtime. 


Whwnever there is exception , the method in which exception occurs will create an object and that object will store three things
1. Exception Name 
2. Description
3. stack trace

We can handle exception by using five keywords 
 1. try - catch
 2. finally  
 3. throw
 4. throws
 
 Throws : throws keywoird is used to declare an exception . it gives information to the caller method that there may occur an exception , so it is better
 for the caller method to provide an exception handling code so that the normal flow of the program is maintained.
